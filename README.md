## 1. Purpose 

The main purpose of this portfolio website is to achieve two things:

- To explore and express my own design/web development styles.

- To present my background, skills, and experience in web development and design.

The website also aims to network with others: prospective employers and other aspiring developers. I hope to showcase my personality and interests, as well as receive feedback and opportunities.
